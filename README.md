Proxy for the [rata.digitraffic.fi](rata.digitraffic.fi) open data API for Finnish rail traffic.

## Usage

Provides the same URIs as the original API, but with substantially reduced
responses. In particular, only the timetable rows which are directly associated with
the specified station are returned.

May also be extended for other purposes beyond the original API.
